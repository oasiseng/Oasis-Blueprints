# Detail library

Construction details kept as data, so the Oasis-Blueprints kit can draw them on a sheet at true scale, in numbered panels,
with the same pens and fonts as the rest of the set. Each detail is one small JSON file (`oasis-blueprints/detail/0.1`).

**These are reference details, not a design.** They were converted from an engineering firm's CAD drawings and redraw what
those drawings show, notes included. A detail belongs on a set only when the engineer of record for that job says it applies,
and it is the engineer who checks it. Details marked "not yet" in the tables below were converted by machine and have not
been compared line by line with their source.

## Use one in a set

In the project file, name the collection folder and list the ids on a sheet of type `details`:

```json
"library": "library/details/typical",
"sheets": [
  { "no": "S5.0", "type": "details", "name": "Standard details", "details": ["62d7e973", "7fd7c8dc"] }
]
```

See `skills/oasis-blueprints/references/project-file.md`, "Library details". A set made only of such sheets uses `"jobType": "library"`.

## Typical details

72 details in [`typical/`](typical/). Index: [`typical/index.json`](typical/index.json).

![First sheet of the typical details](typical/sheets/sheet-01.png)

Every sheet: [1](typical/sheets/sheet-01.png) · [2](typical/sheets/sheet-02.png) · [3](typical/sheets/sheet-03.png) · [4](typical/sheets/sheet-04.png) · [5](typical/sheets/sheet-05.png) · [6](typical/sheets/sheet-06.png) · [7](typical/sheets/sheet-07.png) · [8](typical/sheets/sheet-08.png) · [9](typical/sheets/sheet-09.png) · [10](typical/sheets/sheet-10.png) · [11](typical/sheets/sheet-11.png) · [12](typical/sheets/sheet-12.png).
